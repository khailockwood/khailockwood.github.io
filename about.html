            <h3>My name is Khai and there's many aspects to my life, from baskeball, school, drumming or programming. I was born in San Francisco and moved to Utah when I was seven. I play for Utah Elite basketball and also my school, Rowland Hall. I've been playing for 8 years and still continue basketball. I also enjoy watching basketball, my favorite team being the Utah Jazz. I attend Rowland Hall School and have been here for 3 years. I intend to attend Rowland Hall through high school. I picked up programming when I was 10 and have learned C#, Python and intend to learn many more. I've worked on many projects and continue to work on more, including this website. Lastly, I've been playing drums for 3 years and playing instruments for 9. Starting with the piano, moving to guitar, and now playing drums. I've played in many bands and right now play in the Rowland Hall Jazz band and Caleb Chapman jazz band. Enjoy my website!</h3>
